## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The purpose is to allow users to look up new names in a fun way and create ratings and comments on them. As a user, you can add names to the website which allows other users to vote on the names, create comments and tags. Users also have access to a name chart where the most liked and disliked names are displayed, along with a random name generator. The random name generator will generate a name according to the users preferences.

### Pages

* Name: Displays rating and comments for a given name. This page allows the user to leave comments on names and rate them.
* Account: Displays user information if the user has an account. If the user does not have an account it will show a button saying create account. This page allows the user to create an account.
* Home: Displays a search bar. This page allows the user to look up names and sort names by criterias.
* Randomiser: Displays a number of names from the database. The page allows the user to get a number of random names from the database.
